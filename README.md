# PyCity School_District_Analysis

## Objectives:

### This analysis was performed on behalf of a data scientist client, in order to assess student performance trends and budgeting across multiple schools in the PyCity area. This data will be used to make financial and administrative decisions at both the district and individual school levels.

### After initially exploring the data set and cleaning it up, including removal of missing values and duplicate entries, we analyzed several measures of student testing performance and budget, stratifying by grade and school type as needed.

## Select Findings:
* The average math score across all schools was 64.7
* The minimum reading score observed was 10.5
* For all 9th grade students, the average math and reading scores were 66.7 and 69.3, respectively
* The average reading score for 11th and 12th grade students combined was 74.1
* The average budget for public schools was approximately $911,205, compared to the annual charter school budget of $872,636
* With the exception of 12th graders, average math scores for 9th-11th graders were higher for charter school students than for ones who attended public schools
* Among all schools evaluated, the school with the smallest student population was Chang High School, with 178 students
* Montgomery High School had the largest student population, with 2,152 students total
